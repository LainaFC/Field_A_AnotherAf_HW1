<h4>We have a bunch of hobbies. We espeically love gardening and cooking together. It always brings us closer when we work together. We also love woodworking. We have built things such as coffee tables, planters, signs, and even a cat tree! We find woodworking very relaxing. We absolutly go crazy for watchinig hockey. We both volunteer for the Lucan Irish Junior Hockey Team as the scorekeepers! That way we get front row seats to the action! I personally love knitting and crocheting! It is also very relaxing!<h4>
